It states:\n\n**I = V/R**\n\nWhere:\n\n* **I** is the current (in amperes, A) flowing through the conductor\n* **V** is the voltage (in volts, V) applied across the conductor\n* **R** is the resistance (in ohms, Ω) of the conductor\n\nIn other words, Ohm's Law states that the current flowing through a conductor is", "model": "rag-chat", "latency_ms": 107126, "meta": {"db": "ECEN214", "sources_count": 3}, "source": "frontend_or_api"}

Can you quickly explain power to me?", "response_preview": "Power is the rate at which energy is transferred or converted. It's typically measured in units of watts (W). Think of it like this:\n\n* Energy is like a bucket of water.\n* Power is like the flow rate of water from the bucket.\n\nJust as water flows out of a faucet at a certain rate, power flows through a circuit at a certain rate. The higher the power, the faster the energy is being transferred or converted.\n\nIn simple terms, power is what makes things happen:\n\n* A light bulb uses power to produce light and heat.\n* A motor uses power to move objects", "model": "rag-chat", "latency_ms": 110321, "meta": {"db": "ECEN214", "sources_count": 3}, "source": "frontend_or_api"}

It involves breaking down the circuit into smaller sub-circuits called meshes or meshes of loops, where each mesh represents a loop of conductors that form a closed path.\n\nIn this technique, the current flowing through each mesh is calculated separately, and then the voltage across each mesh is determined using Ohm's Law (V = I × R). The voltage across each mesh is then used to calculate the current flowing through it, and so on.\n\nThe Mesh Current Technique is useful for analyzing complex circuit", "model": "rag-chat", "latency_ms": 120463, "meta": {"db": "ECEN214", "sources_count": 2}, "source": "frontend_or_api"}
