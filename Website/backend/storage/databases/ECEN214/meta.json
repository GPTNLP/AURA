For fractions to be equal to zero, it is sufficient for the numerators to be equal to zero, hence the equations simplify to:\n 𝑅𝑅𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇+𝑅𝑅𝐿𝐿2+ 𝑋𝑋𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇+𝑋𝑋𝐿𝐿2−2𝑅𝑅𝐿𝐿 𝑅𝑅𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇+𝑅𝑅𝐿𝐿=0\n𝑅𝑅𝐿𝐿 𝑋𝑋𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇+𝑋𝑋𝐿𝐿=0\nLooking at the second equation, if we choose 𝑅𝑅𝐿𝐿=0, this would result in 𝑃𝑃𝐿𝐿=0.  \nThis is not what we want ( it minimizes power rather than maximizing it ).  \nTherefore, we need to choose 𝑋𝑋𝐿𝐿=− 𝑋𝑋𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇.  With that choice, the first equation \nsimplifies to\n 𝑅𝑅𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇+𝑅𝑅𝐿𝐿2−2𝑅𝑅𝐿𝐿 𝑅𝑅𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇+𝑅𝑅𝐿𝐿=0\n 𝑅𝑅𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇+𝑅𝑅𝐿𝐿 𝑅𝑅𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇−𝑅𝑅𝐿𝐿=0\nThis leads to 𝑅𝑅𝐿𝐿=± 𝑅𝑅𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇.  Since we can’t use negative resistances, we end up \nwith 𝑅𝑅𝐿𝐿= 𝑅𝑅𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇.\n\nPower Transfer in AC Circuits\nIn summary, power in the load will be maximized if:\n𝑅𝑅𝐿𝐿= 𝑅𝑅𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇\n𝑋𝑋𝐿𝐿=− 𝑋𝑋𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇⇒𝒁𝒁𝐿𝐿= 𝑅𝑅𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇−𝑗𝑗 𝑋𝑋𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇=𝒁𝒁𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇∗.\nWith this solution, the maximum power delivered to the load is:\n𝑃𝑃𝐿𝐿=𝑽𝑽𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇2\n 4𝑅𝑅𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇.\nNote: The previous derivation was done assuming RMS phasors .

The oscilloscope will be used to analyze voltage signals from the \ncircuits that you create in lab. Its primary function is to graph an  instantaneous signal voltage as a \nfunction of time.  \nThe waveforms sampled by the oscilloscope are displayed on a color digital phosphor screen. This \noscilloscope is capable of displaying four signals at once, thus it is a four channel scope. The \nbandwidt h or resolution of the scope is up to 100 MHz. The horizontal time scale can be adjusted \nfrom 1 ns to 10s.  \nThe probes that you will use with the Tektronix Oscilloscope are the professional probes that come \nwith the oscilloscope. We would like all students  to become familiar with using these types of \nprobes. However, you must be VERY CAREFUL when using these probes. Treat them with \nrespect.  \n You can find a user’s manual online and you are encouraged to skim through it .

You can save the readings you take as \neither *.bmp files to insert into your document or *.csv files to use the data in another graphing \nprogram.  \n \nAdjusting the Scales on the Oscilloscope:  \nYou can use the [ Auto Set ] button on the oscilloscope to automatically adjust the view of the \nwaveform. To carry out manual adjustments, use the Vertical and Horizontal [ Scale ] adjustment \non the oscilloscope to adjust the voltage and frequency divisions. The lower knob in the vertic al \nsection controls how zoomed in you are vertically, changing it will change the visible amplitude. \nThe lower knob in the horizontal section controls the zoom settings with respect to frequency. \nThese controls only affect how you view the waveform, not the characteristics of the waveform.  \n \nMeasuring Signal Pa",

The amplitude of the waveforms is voltage, and can range from a low of 100mV peak- to-\npeak (V pp) and a high of 20 V pp. The waveforms can be generated at designated frequencies ranging \nfrom 0.1 mHz to 15MHz. The connections for the function generator are pins that can go into the \nbreadboard or be attached direct ly to the probes  of the oscilloscope. A DC offset can be set.

You will see the \nbuttons to adjust these parameters along the left side of the lower level of buttons. \nFrequency:  How many times the waveform repeats per second (measured in Hz).  \nAppendix C: HP Function Generator   1 \n \n\nRevised May 23, 2017  \n \nAmplitude:  Peak -to-peak voltage of the waveform (measured in mV or V).  This is the \ndifference in voltage between the largest and smallest value of the waveform.  \nOffset:  This is the value of the DC offset (or average) that is added to the periodic signal.  \nFor example, if we wanted to create a square wave with a low value of 0 V and a high value \nof 5V, we would need to use an Amplitude of 5 V (peak- to-peak) and a DC offset of 2.5V. \nTo adjust a parameter, push the button corresponding to the parameter you want to select and then you can adjust the parameter value in one of two ways:  \n1) Turn the knob until the value you want appears.  \n2) Use the arrow keys on the right to edit the numerical value one digit at a time.

For \nnow, let’s focus on making connections in the center of the board.  \n \nFigure  F.1: Breadboard top view. \nWhen we consider a circuit, we know we have elements and nodes in the drawing. There are two \ntypes of nodes on the breadboard. The first are the nodes created with the horizontal holes. For \neach row, the holes labeled ABCDE across the top are electrically connected and therefore form \none node. FGHIJ on the same line form a DIFFERENT node. See Figure F.2 for details.  \n \nFigure  F.2: Details of the 5 Hole Nodes.  \nAppendix F: Breadboards   1 \n \n\nRevised May 17, 2017  \n \nIf two elements should be connected to the same node, they could connect to any two of the holes  \nA, B, C, D or E  of the same row. T he two ends of one element should not be connected in the same \nnode on a breadboard, nor should you try to connect two elements to the same hole in a breadboard.  \n \nA second type of node is created with the holes that run i n vertical  lines. We usually use the vertical \nnodes for our power sources (+) or as our grounds  (-).  All the holes in each vertical line are \nelectrically connected  to one another .  In the breadboard shown in Figure F. 3, a voltage source  is \nconnected to th e (+, red) strip and the ground is connected to the ( -, blue) strip.  In this case, all of \nthe holes along the red line (on the left of the breadboard) are now connected to the voltage source , \nand all of the holes along the blue line are grounded.  This ma kes it easy to connect several circuit \nelements to the voltage source  (or to ground) .  Note, the vertical strips on the right of the \nbreadboard are separate from the ones on the left.  That way, if we want to connect a few different voltage sources to the breadboard, we can.  \n \nFigure F.3: Power and Ground connected to the breadboard.  \n \nTo connect two elements in series, we make sure the elements share only one node in common as \nshown in Figure F.4 below.  \nConnected to \npower supply  Connected to \nground  \nAppendix F: Breadboards   2 \n \n\nRevised May 17, 2017  \n \n \nFigure  F.4: Two resistors connected in series.  \nTo connect two elements in parallel, we connect one side of each  element to the same",

Engineers use a code to determine the values  \nfor the normal ceramic resistors that are commonly used in lab. Each resistor is labeled with 4 bands which, when read from left to right, will tell you how much resistance the \nresistor is  suppose d to have. \n \nThe code is the color bands on the resistors. The way to read them works as follows. For \nthe formula 𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊∗10\n𝑌𝑌±𝑍𝑍%, 𝑊𝑊 is the first band, 𝑊𝑊 is the second band, and 𝑌𝑌 is the third  \nband. 𝑍𝑍 refers to the tolerance of the resistor. To know which color relates to which \nnumeral, we use the table below. The 4th  band, 𝑍𝑍, is usually silver or gold. Silver refers to \na 10% tolerance and Gold Refers to a 5% tolerance.  \n \nColor  Black  Brown  Red Orange  Yellow  Green  Blue  Violet  Gray  White  \nNumber  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 \n \nDo you remember Roy G.

Only university  approved \nabsences or excuses will be accepted to make up any missed work.  \n \nPortable Labs:  In order to allow students the flexibility to do the lab work on their own  schedule, \nwe will be using a portable measurement device (PMD)  to emulate most of the bench lab \nequipment.  This semester we will be using National Instruments Analog Discovery 2 as our PMD.  \nIf you have a different device with similar functionality (e.g., the NI myDAQ), you may use that \nas well, but you should understand that your TA and instructors may not be able to help you as \nefficiently if you are using a differ ent device than the rest of the class.  Even though the PMD  will \nallow your laptop to have the same look and feel of the bench lab equipment, we also want students \nto get their hands on the real bench equipment.  So, in s ome labs you may be asked to  follow up \nthe measurements you make with your PMD  with similar measurements using the bench \nequipment.  There will also be some weeks  where the TA will test you on your ability to make \ntypical measurements using both the PMD  and the bench equipment (Lab Practicu ms). \n \nLab Notebook:   Each student should maintain a lab notebook.  This should be a bound notebook \n(a spiral is OK, but a bound notebook with numbered pages is better) in which the students will \nkeep notes about what they do in the lab as well as record all their data.

Most  week s of the course will have a lab associated with it.  (The actual  start and end date of \nthe lab week may depend on your particular section, your TA should provide you with details).  \nPrior to  the start of the lab week , you are expected to read through the lab manual for that next \nweek’s lab and complete the prelab section.  If you have questions or problems with the prelab, \ndon’t hesitate to contact your TA or your instructor for help.  \n2. Turn in your prelab at the time and place specified by your TA.  \n3. You should complete all the measurements specified in the lab manual either on your own prior \nto your scheduled lab section or during the lab section.   For most of the labs, the lab work \nshould not take more than 1 -2 hours.  If you find you are spending more time than this, get \nwith your TA to determine why your lab work is taking an excessive amount of time.  \n4. If you did your lab work on your own, d uring your lab section you should meet briefly with \nyour TA   to demonstrate how you performed your lab measurements.  Your TA may also work \nwith you to use the lab ben ch equipment to duplicate some of the measurements you made with \nyour PMD .  At this time , your TA will also initial the data pages in your lab book, so make \nsure to br ing your lab notebook to your lab  meeting.  \n5.

Never connect the output of a power supply directly to ground.  \nB. To avoid a mistake such as the one mentioned above, never turn on the power to your circuit  \nuntil you have checked and double checked the circuit.  Be sure all wires are proper ly connected  \nand there is no short from positive to ground. By convention, positive is a red wire and ground \nis a black  wire. Ground is often abbreviated GND. Positive is often abbreviated POS.  \nC. Never  connect a voltage source across your body.

Your PMD  will not ge nerate enough power to hurt you , but some of the bench \nequipment in the lab might.  \nD. Never  have an ope n container of liquid near your lab work . If something happens and water is  \npoured on a circuit, the source could be grounded. This would result in damaged equipment  or \ndamage to your computer .

In our case, the voltage source 𝑉ଵ will be a \nbattery and the goal is to be able to vary the voltage 𝑉ଶ that appears at the output of the voltage \ndivider by varying the values of the resistors 𝑅ଵ and/or 𝑅ଶ. \n \n \nFigure 1.1  – A voltage divider circuit \nThe output voltage of the voltage divider circuit is given by: \n𝑉ଶ= 𝑉ଵ𝑅ଶ\n𝑅ଵ+𝑅ଶ \n \nIn order to make it easy to adjust the values of the various resistors, we will use a potentiometer \n(a.k.a, a “pot”) to adjust the values of one or more of the resistors in the circuit.  Figure 1.2(a) \nshows a picture of a typical pot.  You can envision the pot as a resistive band laid out in a linear \nfashion with a slider that can be moved anywhere within the length of the resistive material (see \nFigure 1.2(b)).  The slider essentially splits the resistance into two parts as shown in Figure 1.2(c).  \nThe two resistances 𝑅௔ and 𝑅௕ must sum to a constant value which is usually printed on the \npackage.  For example, a 10𝑘Ω pot must have  𝑅௔+𝑅௕= 10𝑘Ω.

That is, it produces a fixed voltage regardless of what \nload we place across it.

In particular, the load voltage is found through the use of a simple voltage divider as:  \n \n 𝑉𝐿=𝑉𝑠𝑅𝐿\n𝑅𝐿+𝑅𝑠.  (1)  \n \nIn this lab, we will characterize a practical voltage source by measuring the load voltage for several \ndifferent values of the load resistor.  Alternatively, we could measure the load current for several \ndifferent values of the load resistance which should  be given by  \n \n 𝐼𝐿=𝑉𝑠\n𝑅𝐿+𝑅𝑠. (2) \n \nIn the lab, it is important to remember that although you can often use the same digital multimeter \nto measure both current and voltage, you must measure current by placing the multimeter in series \nwith an element, as shown in Figure 2.2a, and you must mea sure voltage by placing the multimeter \nin parallel with an element, as shown in Figure 2.2b.  \n \n \n  \n \n+ \n_ \n RL \nRs \n+ \n𝑉𝐿 \n_  \nPractical Voltage \nSource Model  \n𝐼𝐿 \n\nRevised September 1, 2021  \n \nPage 2 \nLab 2:  Non -Ideal Sources   \n   \n(a) Ammeter Connection    (b) Voltmeter Connection  \nFigure 2.2:   Circuit diagram for connections.  \n \nIn this lab our voltage source will be a standard household 1.5V AA battery.   \nAmmeter  Voltmeter  \n\nRevised September 1, 2021  \n \nPage 3 \nLab 2:  Non -Ideal Sources  Prelab –  \n \nBe sure to read the entire Lab 2.

Also, it will be best if you can choose load resistance \nvalues that span the range of 50 Ohms to about 2000 Ohms.  Your load  resistances will be \nsomewhat constrained by what you have in your lab kit, but you can use series and parallel \ncombinations of the resistors you have to create other values.  Record your data in your lab \nnotebook in a table similar to Table 1 at the end o f this lab.  Note:  DO NOT connect a resistance \nof less than 10 Ohms across the terminals of the battery.  (In the lab report, explain why this is \nimportant.  Hint:  consider the power rating of the resistors in your parts kit.)  \n \nIn your lab report, you should make a plot of your measured data (plot 𝑉𝐿 vs. 𝑅𝐿).  You should also \nfind the appropriate theoretical curve (e.g., from equation (1)) with values of  (𝑅𝑆,𝑉𝑆) that make \nthe theoretical curve have the “best fit” to the measured data.  In so doing, you will have determined \nthe voltage, 𝑉𝑆, and internal resistance, 𝑅𝑆, of the battery.  A typical plot is shown in Figure 2.5.   \n \nNote 1:  This is completely made up data for illustration purposes only.  Don’t expect your results \nto look exactly like this.  \n \nNote 2:  The theoretical curve governed by equation (1) is not linear (i.e., a straight line). How do \nyou choose the values of (𝑅𝑆,𝑉𝑆) that makes the theoretical curve best fit the data observed?  There \nare a number of ways to do this.  The simplest may be to “linearize” your data.  You should have \ncovered this concept in your Freshmen engineering course, but if not, in our case we can r ewrite \nequation (1) in a linear form as follows  \n𝑉𝐿=𝑉𝑆−𝑉𝐿\n𝑅𝐿𝑅𝑆.     (2) \n \nNow make a plot of your data points as 𝑉𝐿 vs. 𝑉𝐿\n𝑅𝐿.  Use standard curve fitting techniques to fit the \nbest line to the points.  The slope and intercept of that line should provide you with your measured \nvalues of  𝑅𝑆 and 𝑉𝑆. A typical plot of the linearized data is shown in Figure 2.6.  \n \nUltimately you should come up with an estimate of the values of (𝑅𝑆,𝑉𝑆) for your particular \nbattery.

Specifically, you will build two DC circuits to experimentally test these concepts.  The first procedure will verify Thévenin's equivalent circuit.  The second procedure will verify the superposition principle.  After you verify that the superposition principle works, you will also test \nthe conditions under which superposition can be applied.  In this lab, you will also learn more \nabout how SPICE/Multisim can be used to model a circuit.  \n Theory  \n Superposition –  The Superposition principle should have been covered in lecture by this time.  If you need more detail on it before beginning this lab, please read the appropriate sections of your text.  Simply put, superposition holds that if you have a linear circuit with multiple independent sources, you can solve the circuit by solving a circuit with each source in the circuit alone.  Then, summing the individual results, with respect to polarity, should give you the same result as if you solved the circuit with all in dependent sources present.  In this experiment, you will be testing this principle. \n Linear versus non -linear devices –  \nSo far, you have encountered mainly resistors when building circuits.  Resistors are generally modeled as linear devices in this course.  However, there are other devices that are non -linear.  For \nexample, operational amplifiers (Op- Amps) have both a linear and a non- linear range of operation. \n In this lab, while testing the superposition principle for a non-linear circuit, you will have a diode in the circuit.  Figure 3.1 below shows more detail on diodes:  \n+ -\n   Diode current\n+ -\n \nFigure 3.1 \n You will not study diodes in detail in this course, but you will extensively study and use diodes in ECEN 325 and other courses.  There will be occasions in the lab, throughout the semester, where you will use diodes in your circuits.  Therefore, it is a good idea to become familiar with them.  If you have not studied diodes before, the important information you need to know is that current only flows through a diode from the positive (anode) terminal to the negative (cat",

If you have not studied diodes before, the important information you need to know is that current only flows through a diode from the positive (anode) terminal to the negative (cathode) terminal.  Current cannot flow  from the negative side of a diode to the positive side of a diode.  Therefore, \nyou can also consider a diode like a switch.  When current is pushed from the positive to the negative terminals of a diode, the switch is closed.  When current tries to flow from the negative to the positive side of a diode, the switch opens and no current is allowed to flow.  Also, when current is flowing through a diode, there is a voltage drop of approximately 0.7V across the diode (measured from the anode to the cathode).  \n\nRevised September 29, 2021  \n \nPage 2 \nLab 3:  Equivalent Networks and Superposition Viewing and using the Netlist file from SPICE –  \nAfter you create a schematic in SPICE, you have the option of viewing the Netlist.  If there is a \nproblem with your circuit you do not understand, checking the SPICE Netlist (or the circuit file) can help you identify problems.  If you are using LTspice, i n order to view your Netlist, go to the \nView menu and click on, “SPICE Netlist.”  A new file will come up, named, XXX.net, in an editor \nfor you to view.  Each time you change your schematic, a new Netlist is created.  See Appendix I \nfor more details on wor king with LTspice. \n \nFor example, the schematic in Figure 3.2 was drawn in SPICE, and the simulation was run for bias \npoint detail.  (You should recall that the bias point detail allows you to display the voltages and \ncurrents on the schematic.)  \n \nFigure 3.2 – LTspice schematic for a sample circuit  \n \nThe netlist that is created from this schematic is: \nV1 N001 0 V \nR1 N002 N001 1k \nR2 N002 0 1k \nR3 N003 N002 1k \nR4 N003 0 1k R5 N004 N003 1k \nR6 N004 0 1k \nNote how each part is given by its type and name (RX), the two nodes it is connected to (NXXX \nand NXXX), and the value of the component.

The main task is to build a circuit that will detect an interruption in a lig ht \nbeam and trigger an indicator.  In the process of designing this system, you will learn to use op -amps \nto serve various purposes.   \nTheory -The block diagram of the system is shown in Figure 4.1.  The stages to be built and tested \nthis week are enclosed in the dashed box. An IR emitter is employed to send a (non -visible) light beam \nto a photo detector.  The photo detector current induced by th e light beam depends on the strength of \nthe beam.  The first stage in your design will be to build a circuit to convert the current produced by \nthe photo detector to a voltage.  We will investigate a few different configurations for achieving this.   \nSince the output of this first stage may be very small, you will design and build an op -amp based \namplifier to bring the signal strength up to a usable level.  After the voltage is amplified, it will be sent \ninto a comparator which basically decides whet her the light beam is present or is being interrupted.  In \nLab 5, you will build a latch to lock the signal and a system of LEDs to serve as the alarm. In the end, \nwhenever the beam is obstructed, the comparator output will be changed.  It will then be loc ked by a \nlatch circuit and the appropriate LED will light.   \n \nOperational Amplifiers: As discussed in class, a typical op -amp has five connections as shown in \nFigure 4.2: Two inputs, two power supplies, and one output.  In the lab, we will use the LM741 CN op -\namp which comes in an eight pin DIP (dual in -line package) integrated circuit (IC).  The pin \nconnections for this particular op -amp are also shown in Figure 4.2.  Note that there is a small semi -\ncircular notch on one end of the IC so that you can tell  which end is pins 1 -4 and which end is pins 5 -\n8.

Recall the \nideal op -amp assumptions and the resulting equations:  \n \nVirtual Short Condition:  𝑣𝑝=𝑣𝑛 (the voltage on the two inputs will be essentially equal)  \nInfinite Input Resistance:  𝑖𝑝=𝑖𝑛=0 (current into input terminals is essentially zero).  \n \n \n+ \n_ \nPositive  \nPower  \nSupply (7)  \nNegative  \nPower  \nSupply (4)  \nInverting  \nInput (2)  \nNon-\ninverting  \nInput (3)  \nOutput (6)  \nFigure 4.2 – Schematic diagram and pin configuration for the LM741 CN Op -Amp.  \n \nFigure 4.3 – Op-Amp connections on a breadboard.  \n \n\nRevised February 20, 2018  \n \nLab 4: Electronic Security System  3 \n Analysis of op -amp circuits generally starts from these equations.  From there we use Ohm’s Law, \nKVLs, KCLs, etc. until we have determined the currents/voltages we are interested in.  \n \nSpecific Use of an Op -Amp: A Comparator  \n \nA comparator, as shown in Figure 4.4, compares a signal voltage on one input with a reference voltage \non the other input. Without feedback (between the output and the input), an op amp operates in \nsaturation whenever the inputs are not equal. Recall that t he gain of the op -amp is very large.  If we \nforce different voltages on the input terminals, the op -amp will try to make the output voltage very \nlarge, but it cannot create anything larger than the saturation voltage.  If the (+) input of an op amp, 𝑣𝑝, \nis above  its (-) input, 𝑣𝑛, the output voltage, 𝑣𝑜, is pulled up to the positive saturation voltage. If the \n(+) input of an op amp, 𝑣𝑝, is below  its (-) input, 𝑣𝑛, the output voltage is pulled down  to the negative \nsaturation voltage. I n practice , the saturation voltages are a little less (0.5 -1.5 v",

I n practice , the saturation voltages are a little less (0.5 -1.5 volts) than the supply \nvoltages.  \n \nThe output of a general purpose  op-amp such as the 741 has limitations.  Its output changes between \nthe limits fixed by the saturation voltages, +V sat and –Vsat, that might be something like ±11 V for say \na ±12V power supply. Therefore, the output cannot drive devices that require typical logic vol tage \nlevels 0 and +5V , such as logic integrated circuits or microcontrollers.  This problem can be solved by \nusing integrated circuits that have been specifically designed as comparators.  One such device is the \n392 comparator . This device has 2 comparators in one package. You will use one of them. The pin \nlayout of the device is shown in Figure 4.5.  The output of the comparator will be near 0V when the \ninverting input is larger than the non -inverting input.

The flat side of the \nLED is the cathode, which corresponds to the flat line in a diode drawing. In other words, face the \nflat side of the LED in the direction of current flow.  The current will flow from the rounded edge \n(Anode) to the flat edge (Cathode). The second method is to use the lengths of the legs of the LED. \nThis is simple before the LED has been used, but once the legs have been bent or are in the \nbreadboard, this me thod is more difficult. The shorter leg of the LED corresponds to the flat line \nin the diode drawing (Cathode). The current will flow from the Anode to Cathode, so from the \nlonger leg, to the shorter leg. See Figure 4.9 for more details. Either method will  allow you to keep \ntrack of polarity as neither of these devices will function if you hook them up backwards. For the \nemitter (the clear  one), the round side (or long le g) is the anode (A) and the  flat side (or  short le g) \nis the cathode (C).  It essentiall y functions as a diode that emits IR light when there is a current \nflowing through it.  You will have to apply a forward  bias (a positive voltage measured from the \nanode to the cath ode) in order to turn the emitter on.  The detector (the tinted  one) is essentially a \nphoto diode.  Current will flow in proportion to the intensity of the IR light incident on it.  The \nphoto d iode works in reverse bias mode which means a positive voltage must be applied from the \ncathode to the anode.  Again, the  flat side (or short le g) is the cathode (C) and the  round side (or  \nlong le g) is the anode (A).

When the emitter is on, you might be able to see a \ndim glow if you are in a dark room, but sometimes you may not see anything.  However, if you \nlook at the emitter through your cell phone camera, you may see it glowing bright purple when the \nemitter is on  (depending on your phone, this does not work with all phones).   \n \nFirst, assemble the emitter using the simple circuit shown in the left of Figure 4. 10.  The purpose \nof the resistor is to limit the current so as not to damage the emitter.  Since the emitter is rated at a \nmaximum continuous forward current of 5 0mA, the resistor, 𝑅𝐸, should be at least 100𝛺 \n(assuming a +5V supply voltage, if you use a larger value, the resistor value must be increased \naccordingly).   In order to avoid the danger of burning out your emitter, it might be a good idea to \ndesign your emitter circuit (choose resistor values) to produce a current that is safely less than \n50mA (maybe something in the 10 -30mA range) .  Measure the voltages across both the resistor \n\n\nRevised February 20, 2018  \n \nLab 4: Electronic Security System  10 \n and the IR emitter for several different values of 𝑅𝐸.  You should be able to infer the current \nflowing through the emitter 𝐼𝐸 from the voltage measured across the resistor. In your lab report, \nprovide a plot of 𝐼𝐸 vs. 𝑅𝐸. \n \nCaution:  Do not place the supply voltage across the emitter without the current limiting resistor \nin place.  This will cause too much current to flow and will burn out your emitter.  Therefore, you \nmust disconnect the supply voltage before you switch out resistors.  \n \nNext assemble the detector circuit as shown on the right in Figure 4. 10.  The resistor in this circuit \nis playing a completely different role.  As long as there is a sufficient bias voltage across the photo \ndiode, current will flow and the amount of current will be related to the intensity of the IR light \nincident.  The resis tor is now converting the current produced by the photo diode to a voltage.  In \nthe context of Figure 4.1, the resistor 𝑅𝐷 is the “current to voltage converter.”  Measure the voltage, \n𝑉𝐷, for several different values of 𝑅𝐷.

Comment on this \nin your lab report.  \n \n \nTask 3 – Comparator  \nThe last step in this part of the lab will be to use a comparator to change the two output voltages \nyou are reading to standard digital logic levels.  Build the circuit shown in Figure 4.1 4.  The two \nunspecified resistors, 𝑅1 and 𝑅2, function as a voltage divider to bring the +5 volts supply down \nto a proper level to use as the reference voltage for the comparator.

Using \nthe techniques described in class and in the textbook, the differential equation that describes this \ncircuit is found to be  \n𝑑𝑉𝑜𝑢𝑡\n𝑑𝑡+𝑉𝑜𝑢𝑡\n𝑅𝐶=𝑉𝑖𝑛\n𝑅𝐶. \nAssuming that 𝑉𝑖𝑛 is a constant , and that initially the output voltage is  𝑉𝑜𝑢𝑡(0)=𝑉𝑜, the solution \nto this differential equation is  \n𝑉𝑜𝑢𝑡(𝑡)=𝑉𝑖𝑛+(𝑉𝑜−𝑉𝑖𝑛)𝑒−𝑡/𝑅𝐶. \nThe voltage transitions from a starting value of 𝑉𝑜 to a final value of 𝑉𝑖𝑛 in an exponential fashion.  \nThe graph of such  a behavior is shown in Figure 6 .2.  The product, 𝜏=𝑅𝐶, which is given in units \nof seconds, is called the time constant  of the circuit and determines the rate at which the output \nvoltage transitions from its starting to ending values.   Note that by time, 𝑡=5𝜏 (five time \nconstants), the output voltage has very nearly reached its final value.   \nFigure 6.1 – A 1st Order RC Circuit.  \n𝑅 \n𝐶 \n+ \n𝑉𝑖𝑛 \n_ \n+ \n𝑉𝑜𝑢𝑡 \n_ \n\n \n \nIn this lab, we are going to u se the circuit shown in Figure 6 .3.  The analysis of this circuit proceeds \nas follows.  First, using the fact that the current flowing into the non-inverting terminal must be \nzero, it follows that the voltages 𝑉1 and 𝑉𝑜𝑢𝑡 must be related by  a voltage divider,  \n𝑉1=𝑉𝑜𝑢𝑡𝑅2\n𝑅1+𝑅2. \nFigure 6.2 – Transient response of a 1st Order RC Circuit; 𝑉𝑜=1,𝑉𝑖𝑛=5,𝜏=1. \n0 1 2 3 4 5012345\nt (seconds)vout(t)\nFigure 6.3 – An Op -amp based oscillating circuit  \n𝑉2 \n𝑉1 \n741 \n𝑅1 \n  -5V \n+ \n_ \n+5V \n𝑉𝑜𝑢𝑡 \n+ \n_ \n𝑅2 \n𝑅 \n𝐶 \n\nTo simplify future notation, let 𝛾 be the voltage divider, 𝛾=𝑅2\n𝑅1+𝑅2, so that 𝑉1=𝛾𝑉𝑜𝑢𝑡.  Next, \nusing the fact th at the current flowing into the inverting terminal must also be zero, the voltages \n𝑉2 and 𝑉𝑜𝑢𝑡 are found to be related by  \n𝑑𝑉2\n𝑑𝑡+𝑉2\n𝑅𝐶=𝑉𝑜𝑢𝑡\n𝑅𝐶. \nNote that 𝑉1 and 𝑉2 are related to 𝑉𝑜𝑢𝑡 by two very different equations.  As a result, we would \nexpect that 𝑉1≠𝑉2.  If the two inputs to an op -amp are not equal, the op -amp will saturate.  So, at \nthis point it should be pretty clear that this op -amp circuit is operating in saturation",

So, at \nthis point it should be pretty clear that this op -amp circuit is operating in saturation mode.  When \n𝑉2<𝑉1, the output of the op -amp will be 𝑉𝑜𝑢𝑡=+𝑉𝑠𝑎𝑡, and when 𝑉2>𝑉1, we get 𝑉𝑜𝑢𝑡=−𝑉𝑠𝑎𝑡.   \nCase 1:  Consider first the case when 𝑉2<𝑉1.  The voltage 𝑉1 will be constant and equal to 𝑉1=\n𝛾𝑉𝑠𝑎𝑡.  The voltage 𝑉2 will be given by the solution to the differential equation,  \n𝑑𝑉2\n𝑑𝑡+𝑉2\n𝑅𝐶=𝑉𝑠𝑎𝑡\n𝑅𝐶. \nDepending on the initial condition, this solution will be of the form  \n𝑉2(𝑡)=𝑉𝑠𝑎𝑡+(𝑉2(0)−𝑉𝑠𝑎𝑡)𝑒−𝑡/𝑅𝐶. \nThis behavior  will look like that in Figure 6 .2 where it approaches a final value of 𝑉2(𝑡)→𝑉𝑠𝑎𝑡.  \nHowever, since 𝑉1 is smaller than 𝑉𝑠𝑎𝑡, at some point 𝑉2(𝑡) will grow to the point where it becomes \nlarger than 𝑉1.  At that point we switch to the other case.  \nCase 2 : When 𝑉2>𝑉1 we now get 𝑉1=−𝛾𝑉𝑠𝑎𝑡 and 𝑉2 will be of the form  \n𝑉2(𝑡)=−𝑉𝑠𝑎𝑡+(𝑉2(0)+𝑉𝑠𝑎𝑡)𝑒−𝑡/𝑅𝐶. \nNow  𝑉2(𝑡) will decrease over time and approach a final value of 𝑉2(𝑡)→−𝑉𝑠𝑎𝑡.  Again, since 𝑉1 \nis now larger than −𝑉𝑠𝑎𝑡, at some point 𝑉2(𝑡) will decrease to the point where it becomes smaller \nthan 𝑉1.  At that point we switch back to the first case.  \nSo this circuit is going to switch back and forth (oscillate) between the two cases described above.  \nThe voltages involved are all periodic and will behave as shown in Figure 6 .4.  If we take time \n𝑡=0 to be the beginning of a period as shown in Figure 6 .4, the starting voltage for 𝑉2 will be \n\n𝑉2(0)=−𝛾𝑉𝑠𝑎𝑡.  The first switching time will occur when 𝑉2(𝑡)=𝛾𝑉𝑠𝑎𝑡.  We can determine that \ntime by  solving for 𝑡 in the equation  \n𝑉2(𝑡)=𝑉𝑠𝑎𝑡+(−𝛾𝑉𝑠𝑎𝑡−𝑉𝑠𝑎𝑡)𝑒−𝑡/𝑅𝐶=𝛾𝑉𝑠𝑎𝑡. \nAfter a little algebra, this is found to be  \n𝑡=−𝜏ln⁡(1−𝛾\n1+𝛾). \nThis time represents ½ of a period of each of the periodic waveforms.  The resulting frequency \n(1/period) is then  \n𝑓𝑜=−1\n2𝜏ln⁡(1−𝛾\n1+𝛾). \nFor example, for the values given in Figure 6 .4, we would expect the frequency to be 𝑓𝑜=\n0.621Hz and therefore the period is 1.601sec.  \n \n  \nFigure 6.4 – Waveforms in the oscillating op -amp circuit; ⁡𝛾=2\n3,𝜏=0.5𝑠𝑒𝑐. \n0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5-15-10-5051015\nt (seconds)V (volts)\n  \nVout\nV1\nV2\n\nPrelab  \nA.

A few \npointers are listed below.  \n \nTransient Simulation in LTSPICE  \nOnce you have created your schematic diagram of the circuit in SPICE, it is fairly straightforward \nto run a transient simulation.  When you click on the “running man” an “Edit Simulation \nCom mand” box will pop up.  Choose the “Transient” tab.  In this case, the only parameter you \n\nshould need to enter is the “Stop time.”  Since you will be creating perio dic waveforms with a \nperiod of 2  second s and you will want to observe a few periods, you probably want to choose a \nstop time of somethi ng like 6 -10 seconds.

You will probably see a w aveform that is zero for all time.  This \nis because SPICE is assuming there are no initial conditions (all voltages are zero initially) .  With \nno voltage everywhere at time zero, nothing will ever happen in this circuit.  You will need to \nspecify a non -zero initial condition.  To do this, choose “SPICE directive” from the “Edit” menu.  \nAn “Edit Text on Schematic:” box will pop up.  In the  text window, enter something like “.ic \nV(n001)=1”  This is telling SPICE to use an initial condition of 1V at node 001.  You may want \nto use a different node number (or different initial voltage) depending on how your nodes are \nlabelled.  When you click OK you will want to left click in the schematic window to place the text \nSPICE directive in your schematic.  You should se e the text you entered on your schematic now.  \nRun the simulation again with the new initial condition.  Hopefully you are starting to see \nsomething like the waveforms in Figure 6.4.  \nNote:  When you put your schematic together in SPICE, please make sure that you have hooked \nup the correct components to the positive and negative op -amp input terminals.

Figure 6 .6(a) shows a picture \nof typical potentiometer.  You can envision the potentiometer as a resistance laid out in a linear \nfashion with a slider that can be moved anywhere within the length of the resistive material (see \nFigure 6 .6(b)).  The slider essentially splits the resistance into two parts as shown in Figure 6 .6(c).  \nThe two resistances 𝑅1 and 𝑅2 must sum to a constant value which is usually printed on the \npackage.  For example, a 10𝑘Ω pot must have   𝑅1+𝑅2=10𝑘Ω.  By connecting  all three terminal s \nup to a circuit, the potentiometer basically functions as a variable voltage divider.  You can also \nuse the potentiometer as a variable resistor by leaving terminal 3 (or terminal 1) disconnected.  \n \nFigure 6.6 – (a) A typical potentiometer, (b) its schematic, and (c) an equivalent circuit.  \n1 \n 3",

Response of a first order filter to sinusoidal inputs  \n \nThe input/output relationship for the first order RC circuit shown in Figure 7.1 is given by \nthe first order differential equation  \n𝑅𝐶𝑑𝑉𝑜𝑢𝑡(𝑡)\n𝑑𝑡+𝑉𝑜𝑢𝑡(𝑡)=𝑉𝑖𝑛(𝑡). \nAssuming that 𝑉𝑖𝑛(𝑡) is a sinusoid of the generic form  \n𝑉𝑖𝑛(𝑡)=𝐴 𝑐𝑜𝑠(𝜔𝑡+𝜃), \nthe output will be a sinusoid of the same frequency with its amplitude scaled and phase shifted \naccording to  \n𝑉𝑜𝑢𝑡(𝑡)=𝐴\n√1+(𝜔𝑅𝐶 )2 𝑐𝑜𝑠(𝜔𝑡+𝜃−tan−1(𝜔𝑅𝐶 )). \nYou can easily see that this output does in fact satisfy the differential equation above by plugging \nthese forms of 𝑉𝑖𝑛(𝑡) and 𝑉𝑜𝑢𝑡(𝑡) into the equation.  It is common to define the cutoff frequency \nof this circuit as 𝜔𝑐=1/(𝑅𝐶).  In terms of the cutoff frequency, the output is written as  \nFigure 7.1 – A 1st Order RC Circuit.  \n𝑅 \n𝐶 \n+ \n𝑉𝑖𝑛 \n_ \n+ \n𝑉𝑜𝑢𝑡 \n_ \n\n𝑉𝑜𝑢𝑡(𝑡)=𝐴\n√1+(𝜔/𝜔𝑐)2 𝑐𝑜𝑠(𝜔𝑡+𝜃−tan−1(𝜔/𝜔𝑐)). \nFor input frequencies that are small compared to the cutoff frequency, 𝜔≪𝜔𝑐, both the amplitude \nscaling and the phase shift are small so that the output is essentially the same as the input.  On the \nother hand, for input frequencies that are large compared to the cutoff frequency, 𝜔≫𝜔𝑐, the \namplitude scaling will be significant (and the phase shift will be near 𝜋/2).  As a result the output \nwill be much weaker than the input.  We say that the circuit acts as a low -pass filter in that it allows \nlow frequencies to pass but attenuates large frequencies.   It is common to describe the filtering \naction of the circuit in terms of a magnitude response given by  \nMagnitude  response =|𝑉𝑜𝑢𝑡|\n|𝑉𝑖𝑛|= 1\n√1+(𝜔/𝜔𝑐)2, \nand a phase response given by  \nphase  response =∠𝑉𝑜𝑢𝑡−∠𝑉𝑖𝑛=− tan−1(𝜔/𝜔𝑐). \n \nB.

For example, if we were to choose  \n𝑋𝑘={1\n𝑘2,for 𝑘 odd,\n0,for 𝑘 even , \nthen it turns out that 𝑥(𝑡) will be a triangle wave.  Alternatively, we could build a square wave by \nchoosing  \n\n𝑋𝑘={(−1)(𝑘−1)/2\n𝑘,for 𝑘 odd,\n0, for 𝑘 even . \nYou are encouraged to try this for yourself.  Use your favorite computer math package (MATLAB, \nDesmos, etc.) to construct and plot the truncated series  \n𝑥𝑛(𝑡)=∑1\n(2𝑚−1)2cos (2𝜋(2𝑚−1)𝑡)𝑛\n𝑚=1 . \nAs you include more and more terms in the series, the signal will look more and more triangular.  \nFigure 7.2 (blue curve) shows the result with keeping only 5 terms in the series.  \n \nFigure 7.2 – Triangular input (blue) and corresponding output (orange) of a first order RC \ncircuit, 𝜔𝑜=2𝜋 rad/sec, 𝜔𝑐=2𝜋 rad/sec.  \n \nIf a periodic signal 𝑉𝑖𝑛(𝑡) is input to our first order filter, the output can be determined by \nrepresenting the input as a sum of sinusoids and then calling on the concept of superposition to \ndetermine the output.  If the input is written as  \n𝑉𝑖𝑛(𝑡)=∑ 𝑉𝑘𝑐𝑜𝑠(𝑘𝜔𝑜𝑡)∞\n𝑘=0 , \n\n\nthen the output of the first order low -pass filter will be  \n𝑉𝑜𝑢𝑡(𝑡)=∑𝑉𝑘\n√1+(𝑘𝜔𝑜/𝜔𝑐)2𝑐𝑜𝑠(𝑘𝜔𝑜𝑡−tan−1(𝑘𝜔𝑜/𝜔𝑐))∞\n𝑘=0 . \nThat is, the response of the circuit to a sum of sinusoids will be a sum of sinusoids at the same \nfrequencies, each scaled in amplitude and shifted in phase according to their frequencies.   The \norange curve in Figure 7.2 shows the output that corresponds to the triangular input.  Three distinct \ndifferences can be seen between the input and the output. The amplitude of the output is smaller \nthan that of the input, due to the amplitude scaling  caused by the circuit . The output is a bit delayed \nrelative to the input, due to the phase shifting caused by the circuit.  Also, the output is a bit \nsmoother (sinusoidal) looking than the input. This is explained by the low -pass nature of the \ncircuit. With the chosen values of 𝜔𝑜=𝜔𝑐, the first term in the series (the so -called fundamental \nfrequency which has a frequency of 𝜔=𝜔𝑜) has minimal attenuation. It’s amplitude is scaled by \na factor of 1\n√2=0.707.  The next term (the third harmonic which has a frequency of 𝜔=3𝜔𝑜) has \nit’s amplitude scaled",

Higher frequency terms have correspondingly higher attenuation. The RC low -pass filter \nallows the first term in the series to pass with relatively little attenuation, while the other terms are \nlargely blocked. Thus, the output looks like a sinusoid at a frequency of 𝜔=𝜔𝑜 with a little bit of \ndistortion from the residual higher order terms.  \n \nC. Active implementation of first order filter.   \nAt times it is advantageous to implement a first order filter as an active (op -amp) filter.  \nThe circuit shown in Figure 7.3 behaves exactly the same as the one in Figure 7.1.  To see that, \nconsider performing a KCL at the negative  input of the op -amp.

In order to improve your ability to change a square wave into a sine wave, this time you will \nrun the square wave through back -to-back first order filters as shown in Figure 7.4.

Students will connect the analysis techniques learned in class using \ncomplex phasors to real world sinusoidal signals.  \nTheory   \nAs we continue to study 2nd order circuits, we will once again use the Sallen -Key circuit from the \nprevious lab which is reproduced in Figure 9.1.   However, for this lab, we will use an alternating \ncurrent (AC) input to the circuit.  That is, we will apply a sinusoidal voltage to t he circuit and \nobserve the response of the circuit to such inputs.  Furthermore, in the last lab we focused on the \ntransient response of the circuit to a step in the applied voltage.  This time we will focus on the \n(sinusoidal) s teady -state response.    \n \nIn class, you learned how to use phasors to find the steady state response of circuits with AC inputs.  \nWe will do the same with our Sallen -Key circuit.  The phasor representation of the circuit is shown \nin Figure 9.2.  Noting that 𝑉2=𝑉𝑜𝑢𝑡 and performing KCLs at nodes 1 and 2 leads to the following \nequations:  \nFigure 9 .1 – A Sallen -Key 2nd Order Circuit  \n𝑅2 \n𝑉2 \n𝑉1 \n𝑅1 \n+ \n_ \n𝑉𝑜𝑢𝑡(𝑡) \n+ \n_ \n𝐶1\n𝑉𝑖𝑛(𝑡) \n+ \n_ \n𝐶2\n\n𝑉𝑖𝑛−𝑉1\n𝑅1+𝑉𝑜𝑢𝑡−𝑉1\n𝑅2+𝑉𝑜𝑢𝑡−𝑉1\n1/𝑗𝜔𝐶1=0, \n𝑉1−𝑉𝑜𝑢𝑡\n𝑅2=𝑉𝑜𝑢𝑡\n1/𝑗𝜔𝐶2. \nSolving for 𝑉1 in the second equation and substituting into the first (after a little algebraic \nmanipulation) results in the following relationship between the input and output phasors  \n𝑉𝑖𝑛(𝜔)=(1+𝑗𝜔(𝑅1+𝑅2)𝐶2−𝜔2𝑅1𝐶1𝑅2𝐶2)𝑉𝑜𝑢𝑡(𝜔). \n \nIt is common to describe the sinusoidal response of a circuit in terms of a quantity know n as its \ntransfer function , 𝐻(𝜔), which is a function of frequency defined simply as the ratio of the output \nand input phasors,  \n𝐻(𝜔)=𝑉𝑜𝑢𝑡(𝜔)\n𝑉𝑖𝑛(𝜔). \nGiven this definition and the relationship above, our Sallen -Key circuit has a transfer function \ngiven by  \n𝐻(𝜔)=1\n1+𝑗𝜔(𝑅1+𝑅2)𝐶2−𝜔2𝑅1𝐶1𝑅2𝐶2. \nTwo related quantities which we will measure in this lab are the magnitude response  of the circuit \nwhich is just the absolute value of the transfer function, |𝐻(𝜔)|, and the phase response  which is \n1/𝑗𝜔𝐶 2 \nFigure 9 .2 – The Sallen -Key Circuit in the Phasor Domain  \n𝑅2 \n𝑽𝟐 \n𝑽𝟏 \n𝑅1 \n+ \n_ \n𝑽𝒐𝒖𝒕(𝝎) \n+ \n_ \n1/𝑗𝜔𝐶 1 \n𝑽𝒊𝒏(𝝎) \n+ \n_ \n\nthe angle of the tr",

A typical plot of the magnitude and phase responses are shown in Figure 9.3.  The \nfrequency variable 𝜔 is expressed in units of radians/second.  Note that in the plots in Figure 9.3 \nthe frequency axis has been scaled by a factor of 2𝜋 so that frequency can be expressed in Hz.  \nLook at the expression for the magnitude response of this circuit (or look at the plot in Figure 9.3).  \nYou should be able to convince yourself that the following statements are true:  \n|𝐻(0)| =1   and   |𝐻(∞)| =0. \nWhat this means is that for low frequencies ( 𝜔→0) the output signal will have the same \nmagnitude as the input signal, while for high frequencies ( 𝜔→∞) the output signal will have a \nmagnitude of zero.  In other words, this circuit acts as a filter that allows low frequencies to pass \nand attenuates high frequencies.  We say that the circuit is a low-pass filter .
